# Minecraft in C++ and OpenGL

This is a bad minecraft clone and my first OpenGL application I have made that wasn't from a tutorial.

## Controls

The controls are the same as minecraft's controls.

> Use the mouse to look around.

> WASD to move around.

## To do

> I am yet to add mining (I will soon)

> Add more than one block
