# Minecraft in C++ and OpenGL

This is a bad Minecraft clone and my first OpenGL application I have made that wasn't from a tutorial.

## Controls

The controls are the same as Minecraft's controls.

* Use the mouse to look around.
* WASD to move around.
* Space to jump
* C to enable / disable flying
* Left click to remove blocks
* Right click to place blocks

## To do

* Add more than one block
* Lighting
