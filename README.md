This is a bad Minecraft clone and my first OpenGL application I have made that wasn't from a tutorial.

## Controls

The controls are the same as Minecraft's controls.

* Use the mouse to look around.
* `W``A``S``D` to move around.

* `C` to toggle flying
* `Left click` to remove blocks
* `Right click` to place blocks
* `F` toggles fog

## Features

## To do
